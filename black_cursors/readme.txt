
	WINDOWS 10 CURSORS, BLACK VERSION, SUPPORTS HIDPI	

	1. Right-click the 'install.inf' file and click "Install"

	2. Open Windows > Control Panel > Mouse 
	
	3. Change your cursor set to the "Windows black" cursor set

	note: arrow_r.cur shows the wrong thumbnail for some reason, but it's just the old style black cursor that comes with every version of windows. i liked it more than the deviantart version
